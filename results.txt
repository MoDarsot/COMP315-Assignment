TeNi
Te: Te is the primary way TeNi’s interact with the world around them. Te is all about efficiency and getting things done. It is the TeNi’s primary decision-making process, which means that if a decision is needed in the moment, they will rely on what makes the most sense logically. They are primarily concerned with moving forward and are not interested in wasting time and energy nitpicking a solution to death before applying it. Their solution is the "perfect" solution in the moment. The best, most effective solution is often obvious to them, and they are masters of maximization and efficiency.
Ni: Ni is the way that a TeNi perceives their inner world, it dictates the way they store information and how they perceive that information. It also heavily dictates the path that their train of thought will take. Ni tends to store information in a spread out way with all the pieces of data having connections of various strengths to multiple additional pieces of data. This creates a dense web-like mass of information that is too large to be viewed in detail as a whole, but can be zoomed in on to show intricate clusters and threads of thoughts. This network of data rests slightly outside of the conscious mind, giving Ni a dreamlike quality that is equally likely to be experienced in images and impressions as it is to produce concrete facts. Because the focus of the Ni perception is constantly scanning the whole but also frequently zooming in on various thoughts and feelings and changing angles on a subject, they tend to experience their inner world as constantly fluctuating.
Se: Se helps the TeNi use their senses to understand the world around them. They enjoy living in the moment and are capable when it comes to dealing with things that they can experience and touch in addition the purely hypothetical. This is because their Ni and Se fall in the middle as far as preferences go, so they’re able to flip back and forth to use each one as it’s needed. Se is also what drives them to search out playful new sensory experiences.
Fi: Fi is their last function. Fi helps them to assess situations to see how things match up to their values and beliefs. They may think of their Fi as their “gut instinct”. It helps them learn to be sensitive to the values and feelings of those around them. It can act as a warning system when they think a decision makes sense logically, but somewhere inside, Fi is the alarm saying it’s a bad idea. However, because Fi is the TeNi’s weakest function, they will often act with the swift decisiveness of Te first, before considering how their actions might affect the feelings of others or taking time to think about whether their decision lines up with their values.

NeFi
Ne: Ne is the NeFi’s core function. They use it to find patterns and underlying principles, to see future possibilities, to construct theories and frameworks, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. To others, Ne is what can make the NeFi seem like they have their head in the clouds, constantly having ideas, thoughts, and theories that might not seem like they’re totally in sync with reality. The rest of the functions below are said to "serve" the Ne. This means that the Ne way of doing things gets priority most of the time.
Fi: Although it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. NeFi’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that makes them very interested in determining their own moral code and what their gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and are likely to be highly aware of how they feel other people see them. It may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. This values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude, which can make the NeFi seem very introverted in these times. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow to them.
Te: Te is the NeFi’s third function. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. NeFi’s tend to be balanced between this quick, decisive efficient way of making decisions and the pondering, value-driven decision making process of their Fi. While they prefer to take their time to make decisions, as long as it doesn’t go against their values they can use their Te to make sure they make a decision when necessary.
Si: Si is the NeFi’s last function. Because of this, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions. It operates subconsciously for the most part, and allows them to store all the interesting knowledge and insights into people they gather in an organized way in their mind for future reference. People with Si first or second are really good at implementation, following detailed instructions, and keeping a system running smoothly over long periods of time. Because Si is not the main focus of an NeFi, they may struggle with being consistent, reliable, and actually implementing their ideas. However, as they grow and develop, they often learn to overcome these weaknesses.

FeNi
Fe: Fe is the FeNi’s primary function and is what they use to communicate with the world. It is also how the world communicates back to them. Fe is not about emotions, but the gut instincts they might have about a person or situation. This function is focused outwardly and is primarily motivated and energized by the presence of other awesome people. Because Fe is first, all the other functions “serve” it.
Ni: While Fe gathers information about people, Ni is running internally in the background, taking information and forming it into constellations of data that merge to become an idea or thought. Ni makes the internal world very abstract for the FeNi.
Se: Se supports Fe as it helps fuel the FeNi’s impressions of the world around them. It appreciates the world as a concrete thing. Se makes them enjoy using their senses to understand and interact with the world around them.
Ti: Ti is the FeNi’s last function, which means it can be their Achilles heel before it’s well developed. Their Ti helps them examine and analyze information that Fe collects. Ti, along with their Ni instinct, helps them determine if their ideas and opinions stand up to scrutiny. However, because Ti is their weakest link, they might have trouble when asked to analyze complex theoretical problems in their head—i.e. intricate math equations.

NeTi
Ne: Ne is NeTi’s core function. They use it to find patterns and underlying principles, to see future possibilities, to construct theories and frameworks, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. To others, Ne is what can make the NeTi seem like they have their head in the clouds, constantly having crazy ideas that don’t always seem in sync with reality. The rest of the functions below are said to "serve" the Ne. This means that the Ne way of doing things gets priority most of the time.
Ti: Ti is what fuels the NeTi’s drive for knowledge and general focus on intellectual pursuits. It comes second in the “functional stack”, and it operates mostly in the background, doing analysis on the ideas that Ne seems to grasp out of thin air. It provides a logical framework and reference material to determine which ideas are logical and which are not. This is important as it can help to bring balance in response to especially fantastical ideas.
Fe: Fe is third, and is where the NeTi’s humanitarian side originates. In social situations, it can make them a more expressive, eloquent, and otherwise skilled conversationalist, to the point where convincing others to believe in their ideas can be quite easy to do. It is also a major cause behind their drive to use their intelligence and creative problem solving skills to help others and make the world a better place, rather than using them for purely selfish purposes.
Si: Si is the NeTi’s last function. Because of this, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions. It operates subconsciously for the most part, and allows stores all the interesting facts and knowledge they gather in an organized way in their brain for future reference. People with Si first or second are really good at implementation and keeping a system running smoothly over long periods of time. Because Si is weakest for the NeTi, they may struggle with being consistent, reliable, and actually implementing their ideas. However, as they grow and develop, they often learn to overcome these weaknesses.

SeFi
Se: Se is the main way SeFi’s take in information. It means they use their senses to understand the world around them. They live in the moment and prefer dealing with things that are real and solid over the purely hypothetical. Se is the part of SeFi’s that makes them search out playful new sensory experiences.
Fi: Although it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. SeFi’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that makes them very interested in determining their own moral code and what the SeFi’s gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. The values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow.
Te: Te is the SeFi’s third  function. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. SeFi’s are pretty balanced between this quick, decisive efficient way of making decisions and the pondering, value-driven decision making process of their Fi.
Ni: Ni is the SeFi’s last function and may be their achilles heel, and is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Se. Ni allows them to pull from every area in their brain to find valuable data, to look for patterns in the information they gather, or to skip ten steps ahead and predict what will happen in the future. Ni makes their internal world abstract and can involve jumping around on intuitive leaps. In the SeFi, Ni might give them the sense that it’s okay to not have everything figured out. Overuse of an inferior function can be very draining, and may be unhealthy when constantly given priority over other functions.

TeSi
Te: Te is the primary way TeSi’s interact with the world around them. Te is all about effectiveness and getting things done. It is the TeSi’s primary decision-making process, which means that if a decision is needed in the moment, they will rely on what makes the most sense logically. They are primarily concerned with moving forward and are not interested in wasting time and energy nitpicking a solution to death before applying it. They make the best decision they can given the probabilities they're presented with. The most effective functional or workable solution is often obvious to them, and they are masters of maximization. Te can also make them quite competitive.
Si: TeSi’s naturally use Si to catalogue experiences and information they deem important. In particular, they remember their impressions of experiences they’ve had. They have an organized internal world and their mind can easily put similar pieces of information into appropriate categories. They learn straightforward, practical systems, rules, and strategies with ease and grace. Si gives the sense of the TeSi being grounded and can make them seem like they have a very linear, black and white way of thinking about things. (Though in reality they may see everything as shades of grey.)
Ne: Ne is the part of the TeSi that craves new experiences and ideas. For example, when coming up with an idea to execute a project, they can take a lot of details they’ve gathered from previous experience and put them together to form a really great concept. Ne can also fuel sudden “lightbulb” moments where an idea strikes them out of nowhere as they’re talking. It makes the TeSi likely to enjoy taking disparate things and thoughts and gluing them together to see what happens. It can also cause them to lapse into a sort of factual story-telling mode at any moment.
Fi: Fi is their last function. Fi helps them to assess situations to see how things match up to their values and beliefs. They may think of their Fi as their “gut instinct”. It helps them learn to be sensitive to the values and feelings of those around them. It can act as a warning system when they think a decision makes sense logically, but somewhere inside, Fi is the alarm saying it’s a bad idea. However, because Fi is the TeSi’s weakest function, they will often act with the swift decisiveness of Te first, before considering how their actions might affect the feelings of others or taking time to think about whether their decision lines up with their values. As the TeSi ages, they get much better at using their Fi towards the beginning of their decision-making process. Although the most effective option takes priority, they become more aware and careful about doing things that would hurt those around them.

SeTi
Se: Se is the main way SeTi’s take in information and their core function. This means they use their senses to understand the world around them and they handle solid, real world information better than vague hypotheticals. They live in the moment and need to constantly seek out adventure and fun, sensory experiences to keep Se happy.
Ti: Ti is what fuels their drive to understand the world, as well as their focus on mastering hands-on skills and talents. It comes second in their “functional stack”, and it operates mostly in their subconscious. It primarily does analysis on the ideas that their Se creates based on their experiences. It provides a logical framework and reference material to determine which ideas are logical and which are not, and to figure out how they might be implemented. Because Ti is serving Se, it primarily seeks knowledge as a “tool” that can be wielded to solve problems.
Fe: Fe is third, and is where the SeTi’s humanitarian side originates. It is a major factor in their drive to use their problem-solving skills to help others and make the world a better place, rather than using them for purely selfish purposes. In social situations, it often combines with Se to make them huge jokers. Although they’re a more extroverted type, they often get into social situations where they just enjoy the company and don’t feel the need to say much. Because of their strong Se, they often choose to show affection for others through their actions as it tends to be the most comfortable for them.
Ni: Ni is the SeTi’s last function and is often their achilles heel. It is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Se. Ni allows them to pull from every area in their brain to find valuable data, to look for patterns in the information they gather, or to skip ten steps ahead and predict what will happen in the future. Ni makes their internal world abstract and can involve jumping around on intuitive leaps. It can also give them the sense that it’s okay to not have everything figured out. Overuse of their Ni can be very draining, and may be unhealthy if it’s constantly given priority over other functions.

FeSi
Fe: Fe is the FeSi’s primary function and is what they use to communicate with the world. It is also how the world communicates back to them. Fe is not about emotions, but the "gut instincts" they might have about a person or situation. This function is focused outwardly and is primarily motivated and energized by the presence of other awesome people. Because Fe is first, all the other functions “serve” it.
Si: While Fe gathers information about people, Si is running internally in the background to keep track of this information in an organized fashion—like a filing cabinet or a very organized library. Si helps FeSi’s remember data that is important to them and helps them to determine if things are "right" or "wrong" based on the data that is collected by Fe.
Ne: Ne supports Fe as it helps fuel the FeSi’s instincts about the world around them. It helps them navigate unfamiliar situations and see potential in people. Ne also helps keep their Si in check, so that when they use Si they don’t become too set in their ways, which can isolate some people.
Ti: Ti is the FeSi’s last function, so it can be their Achilles heel. Their Ti, in tandem with Si, helps them examine and analyze information that Fe collects. Ti helps them determine if their ideas and opinions stand up to scrutiny. However, because Ti is their weakest link, they might have trouble when asked to analyze complex theoretical problems in their head—i.e. intricate math equations.

NiTe
Ni: Ni is like a background processor that can compute and process information without needing to consciously work through each part of the thought. It’s easily able to see ten steps ahead and predict what might happen in the future because. Ni-dominant types are able to access many parts of their brain at once to find an optimal solution to new problems. Because Ni is the NiTe’s main function, everything else is said to serve it.
Te: Te allows NiTe’s to operate efficiently in all areas of life. It is the NiTe’s primary decision-making process, which means that if a decision is needed in the moment, they will rely on what makes the most sense objectively. Because Te is the primary external function, it is usually the first thing other people will notice about NiTe’s.
Fi: Fi is the NiTe’s third function. It is the NiTe’s secondary decision-making process and can take longer to come to a conclusion than Te does. Because it’s an internal process, it likes to mull over all the details before deciding. Fi is what tells the NiTe how they feel or how others might feel about a particular thing. It can act as a warning system when Te thinks a decision makes sense but Fi knows it’s a bad idea.
Se: Se is the NiTe’s last function. As a last function, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions. Se is the NiTe’s more concrete side that lets them connect to the world around them. Having Se last means that NiTe’s can easily get drained if they have to actively engage with the people or the world around them for long periods of time.

FiNe
Fi: Although it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. FiNe’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that is very interested in determining its own moral code and what the FiNe’s gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. The values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow.
Ne: Ne is the main way FiNe’s take in information. This means they use their intuition to find patterns, underlying principles, and ideas, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. Ne flourishes when given new, interesting concepts to consider and consistently seeks out new inspiration from the outside world. For the FiNe, Ne is paired with Fi and “serves” it in the sense that it comes after it in terms of preference. This means that Ne will most often be used to explore values and ideals in all of their facets. Because Ne is extroverted, it primarily works by engaging with outside sources. This may look like having discussions with others who are also open to exploring the possibilities of a topic, or doing a lot of self-expression through writing or an art form.
Si: Si is the FiNe’s third function, and it gives a sense of solidity to their Fi beliefs. Si also makes the Fi-led internal world structured and detailed. When it comes to values that they have had adequate time to develop, they tend to have a solid sense of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. A lot of their perception in these cases is based on their personal experiences. This is because Si places a high value on real world experiences and its impressions of them. FiNe’s store all the interesting experiences and information they gather in their mind in an organized way for future reference. 
Te: Te is the FiNe’s inferior function. This function may be their achilles heel, and is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Fi. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. FiNe’s generally prefer only to use Te only when necessary, rather than to make all of their decisions. Overuse of an inferior function can be very draining, and may be unhealthy when constantly given priority over other functions.

NiFe
Ni: Ni is the way that an NiFe perceives their inner world, it dictates the way they store information and how they perceive that information. It also heavily dictates the path that their train of thought will take. Ni tends to store information in a spread out way with all the pieces of data having connections of various strengths to multiple additional pieces of data. This creates a dense web-like mass of information that is too large to be viewed in detail as a whole, but can be zoomed in on to show intricate clusters and threads of thoughts. This network of data rests slightly outside of the conscious mind, giving Ni a dreamlike quality that is equally likely to be experienced in images and impressions as it is to produce concrete facts. Because the focus of the Ni perception is constantly scanning the whole but also frequently zooming in on various thoughts and feelings and changing angles on a subject, Ni dominant people tend to experience their inner world as constantly fluctuating.
Fe: Fe is the NiFe’s first extroverted function, so this is the function that the NiFe is most likely to use when interacting with the outer world and it is the filter through which they receive communication from the rest of the world. Fe is also the way that the NiFe processes their emotions. This function serves Ni and is primarily focused on other people.
Ti: Ti makes decisions based on logic and operates internally. Ti helps to stabilize the shifty nature of Ni and helps the NiFe to interpret their Ni connections in a sensible way. This function can help them to fully understand the connections that Ni makes outside of the conscious realm.
Se: Se is the NiFe’s last and least developed function. This function is what perceives the outer world as stable, concrete, and structured. It’s also the function that helps an NiFe to be aware of their surroundings, appreciate beauty, be fully present in the moment, and feel connected to the physical world. This function is operating at a low level on the NiFe’s awareness radar and gives them only the minimum input required for the tasks they are doing unless the NiFe actively engages this function. Unfortunately for the NiFe, they can experience the outer world as overwhelming and stressful if they spend too much time actively taking in outside stimulus, or if real world facts and data escalate to an intensity that demands the NiFe’s full focus.

TiNe
Ti: TiNe's use Ti to make decisions based on logical analysis done over time in their heads. Ti is the reason they prize rationality and objectivity. It also drives their insatiable thirst for knowledge and learning. Because it is their strongest preference, the functions below are said to "serve" the Ti. This just means that the Ti way of doing things gets priority most of the time.
Ne: Ne is the main way TiNe’s take in information. It means they use their intuition to find patterns, underlying principles, and ideas, to construct theories and frameworks, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. It can make them seem quite "rambley" at times as they can jump from topic to topic based on the connections they're making in the moment rather than following a more linear path of conversation.
Si: Si is the TiNe’s third function, and it allows them to store all the interesting facts and knowledge they gather in their brain in an organized way for future reference. Si also makes the Ti-led internal world fairly structured and detailed in its analysis, and can often lead to a very strong sense of internal stability which can come across as arrogance to others. While they can jump from topic to topic in conversation, internally their thought patterns are more linear. For TiNe's in particular, their Si drives them to have a high need for precise language, and they can often articulate themselves very well when they want to. As they get older, their thought processes get faster. After some time they will likely not need to consciously think through every step in a thought process unless they're taking on a very novel problem or task.
Fe: Fe is the TiNe’s last function. As a last function, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions and the TiNe generally prefers to only use it where necessary, rather than using to make all their decisions. Fe is the TiNe’s humanitarian side. It causes them to want to use their intelligence and creative problem-solving to help others and fix the world in some way. Having Fe last means that TiNe’s often start out life being less aware of and equipped to deal with feelings than other types. Even though it's last, a healthy TiNe will learn to develop all of their functions over time so they can use them as needed.

FiSe
Fi: Although it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. FiSe’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that is very interested in determining its own moral code and what the FiSe’s gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. The values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow.
Se: Se is the main way FiSe’s take in information. It means they use their senses to understand the world around them. They live in the moment and prefer dealing with things that are real and solid over the purely hypothetical. Se is the part of FiSe’s that makes them search out playful new sensory experiences.
Ni: Ni is the FiSe’s third function, and it allows them to pull from every area in their brain to find valuable data, to look for patterns in the information they gather, or to skip ten steps ahead and predict what will happen in the future. Ni makes the Fi-led internal world very abstract and can involve lots of jumping around on intuitive leaps.
Te: Te is the FiSe’s inferior function. This function may be their achilles heel, and is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Fi. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. FiSe’s generally prefer only to use Te only when necessary, rather than to make all of their decisions. Overuse of an inferior function can be very draining, and may be unhealthy when constantly given priority over other functions.

SiTe
Si: SiTe’s naturally use Si to catalogue experiences and information they deem important. In particular, they remember their impressions of experiences they’ve had. They have an organized internal world and their mind can easily put similar pieces of information into appropriate categories. They learn straightforward, practical systems, rules, and strategies with ease and grace and love when something is done right. Si gives the sense of the SiTe being grounded and having a linear, black and white way of thinking about things.
Te: Te is the primary way SiTe’s interact with the world around them. Te makes them loves efficiency and getting things done, and can enjoy a bit of healthy competition at times if they feel like they have a chance at winning. It is the SiTe’s primary decision-making process, which means that if a decision is needed in the moment, they tend to rely on what makes the most sense logically. They are more concerned about moving forward than they are about it being the perfect solution. Because Te is the primary external function, it is usually the first thing other people will notice about SiTe’s.
Fi: Fi is the SiTe’s third function. Fi is sensitive to the feelings of others and the atmosphere they’re in, and they use it to assess situations to see how things match up to their values and beliefs so they can act accordingly. They may think of their Fi as their gut instinct. It can act as a warning system when Te thinks a decision makes sense logically, but somewhere inside, Fi knows it’s a bad idea. Since Fi is internal, SiTe’s need more time to mull over the details of decisions that involve their beliefs or values. Because Fi is right after Te in order of preference, SiTe’s can be quite balanced between their action-oriented analytical side and the side of them that ponders their beliefs and values and the meaning behind things.
Ne: Ne is the SiTe’s last function. Ne is the small part of the SiTe that craves new experiences and ideas, but because it is their weakest function, it can only be used in simple ways or for short periods of time. For example, when coming up with an idea to execute a project, they can take a lot of details they’ve gathered from previous experience and put them together to form a really great concept, but coming up with an idea about a project when they have no relevant practical experience catalogued away can be very difficult. Ne can also fuel sudden “lightbulb” moments where an idea strikes them out of nowhere as they’re talking.

TiSe
Ti: Ti makes decisions based on logical analysis done over time in their head. Because it is the TiSe's strongest preference, the functions below are said to "serve" the Ti. This just means that the Ti way of doing things gets priority most of the time.
Se: Se is the main way TiSe’s take in information. It means they use their senses to understand the world around them. They live in the moment and prefer dealing with things that are real and solid over the purely theoretical.
Ni: Ni is the TiSe’s third function, and it allows them to pull from every area in their brain to find solutions to problems, to look for patterns in the information they gather, or to skip ten steps ahead and predict what will happen in the future. Ni makes the Ti-led internal world very abstract and can involve lots of jumping around on intuitive leaps. This can make it hard for TiSe’s to fully explain the method they used to reach a certain conclusion.
Fe: Fe is the TiSe’s last function. As a last function, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions. Fe is the TiSe’s humanitarian side. It causes them to want to use their intelligence and creative problem-solving to help others and fix the world in some way. Having Fe last means that TiSe’s start out life being less aware of and equipped to deal with feelings than other types.

SiFe
Si: SiFe’s naturally use Si to catalogue experiences and information they deem important. In particular, they remember their impressions of experiences they’ve had. They have an organized internal world and their mind can easily put similar pieces of information into appropriate categories. They learn straightforward, practical systems, rules, and strategies with ease and grace. Si gives the sense of the SiFe being grounded and having a linear, black and white way of thinking about things.
Fe: Fe is the primary way SiFe’s interact with and understand the people in the world around them. It is not emotions, but “gut instincts” they might have about a person or situation. This function is focused outwardly and reads or “takes in” information about other people. It picks up on their vibes and what their thoughts and feelings might be. Fe also helps SiFe’s relate back to and communicate with people in a way that people are comfortable with.
Ti: Ti analyzes information and seeks truthful answers to all of life’s questions. When Ti serves Si in an SiFe, it analyzes things in a categorical, organized manner, and seeks truth about experiences and situations. Because Ti is right after Fe in order of preference, SiFe’s can be very balanced between their stoic analytical side and the side of them that values people.
Ne: Ne is the SiFe’s last function. Ne is the small part of the SiFe that craves simple new experiences and ideas, but because it is their weakest function, it can only be used in simple ways or for short periods. For example, when coming up with an idea to execute a project, they can take a lot of details they’ve gathered from previous experience and put them together to form a really great concept, but coming up with an idea about a project when they have no relevant practical experience catalogued away can be very difficult. Ne can also fuel sudden “lightbulb” moments where an idea strikes them out of nowhere as they’re talking.
